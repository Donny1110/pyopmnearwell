==================
Configuration file
==================

The following configuration file is available in the `examples <https://github.com/daavid00/pyopmnearwell/blob/main/examples>`_ folder 
in the Github repository and in the :doc:`examples <./examples>` documentation section the simulation results are shown.

The first input parameter in the configuration file is:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    """Set the full path to the flow executable and flags"""
    flow --enable-opm-rst-file=true 

If **flow** is not in your path, then write the full path to the executable
(e.g., /Users/dmar/Github/opm/build/opm-simulators/bin/flow). We also add in the same 
line as many flags as required (see the OPM Flow documentation `here <https://opm-project.org/?page_id=955>`_).

.. note::
    If you have installed flow with MPI support, then you can run the simulations in
    parallel by adding **mpirun -np N flow ...** where N is the number of cpus.

****************************
Reservoir-related parameters
****************************

The following input lines are:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 4

    """Set the model parameters"""
    co2store     #Model (co2store/h2store)
    radial 36    #Grid type (radial/cake/cartesian2d/cartesian) and size (theta/theta/width/- [in degrees])
    100 24       #Reservoir dimensions [m] (Lenght and height)
    50 48 2      #Number of x- and z-cells [-] and exponential factor for the telescopic x-gridding (0 to use an equidistance partition)
    0.1 0        #Well diameter [m] and well transmiscibility (0 to use the computed one internally in Flow)
    1e7 40       #Pressure [Pa] on the top and uniform temperature [Â°]
    1e10         #Pore volume multiplier on the boundary [-] (0 to use well producers instead)[-]
    1 5 6        #Activate perforations [-], number of well perforations [-], and lenght [m]
    4 1          #Number of layers [-] and hysteresis (1 to activate)  

Here we first select the physical model. To add additional models (e.g., blackoil), one could look at the 
`opm-tests <https://github.com/OPM/opm-tests>`_ decks, convert the necessary input decks and files to mako
templates, add them to the src/pyopmnearwell/templates folder, and extending the Python scripts in the 
src/pyopmnearwell/utils folder. In the following line we select between a grid with radial
coordinates, a "piece of cake" generated by a corner-point grid, a cartesian grid with 2D flow (x and z directions),
or a 3D Cartesian grid. The second entry defines the theta aperture for the radial/cake grids, the width of the cells
for the cartesian2d grid, or it is ignored for the 3D cartesian grid (the width and number of cells is set equal to 
the ones in the x directions). Then we set the length and height of the reservoir,
as well as the number of grid elements in the x and z direction (for the y/theta direction we consider only one
element, with exception to the cartesian grid where the width and number of cells is set equal to 
the ones in the x directions). The third entry defines the exponential factor for the telescopic serie used to generate the x partition (if 
set to 0 then an equidistance partition is generated). 

.. figure:: figs/gridding.png

    Four different grids by setting the line # 6 to 'radial 36' (top left, showing the depth), 'cake 60' (top right, showing the y-direction cell size), 
    'cartesian2d 1' (bottom left, showing the x-direction cell size), and cartesian 1 (bottom right, showing the cell pore volume).

We then define the diameter of the well, the well transmissibility (0 to use the 
computed one internally in Flow), the reservoir pressure on the top and the factor to multiply the pore volume on 
the boundaries to model an open-boundary (0 to add production wells intead). On line 12 there is an option to activate perforations around
the well. i.e., to add heterogeinity by adding a defined number of layers by a given length. Finally, the number of different rocks along the 
z direction is defined as well as the possibility to include hysteresis effects. 


***********************
Rock-related parameters
***********************
The following entries define the rock related parameters:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 15

    """Set the saturation functions"""
    krw * ((sw - swi) / (1.0 - sni -swi)) ** nkr             #Wetting rel perm saturation function [-]
    krn * ((1.0 - sw - sni) / (1.0 - sni - swi)) ** nkr      #Non-wetting rel perm saturation function [-]
    pec * ((sw - swi) / (1.0 - sni - swi)) ** (-(1.0 / npe)) #Capillary pressure saturation function [Pa]

In this example we consider properties for the sands number 2 to 5 as described in the 
`11th SPE CSP <https://www.spe.org/en/csp/>`_:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 20

    """Properties saturation functions"""
    """swi [-], sni [-], krn [-], krw [-], pec [Pa], nkr [-], npe [-], threshold cP evaluation"""
    SWI2  0.14 SNI2  0.1 KRW2  1 KRN2  1 PRE2  8655 HNKR2 2 HNPE2 2 THRE2  1e-4

    HSWI5 0.24 HSNI5 0.2 HKRW5 1 HKRN5 1 HPRE5 3060 HNKR4 3 HNPE5 2 HTHRE5 1e-4
    HSWIP    0 HSNIP   0 HKRWP 1 HKRNP 1 HPECP    0 HNKRP 1 HNPEP 1 HTHREP 1e-4

Since the 'activate perforations option' is set to 1, then we add an extra line after the 4 rock properties
to define the ones in the perforations (Line 26). Since the hysteresis option is activated, then the 
imbibition saturation functions are defined by adding as many additional lines as number of rocks (+1
if the perforations are activated, Lines 27 to 31 in this example).  

Now for the rock properties:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 33

    """Properties rock"""
    """Kxy [mD], Kz [mD], phi [-]"""
    PERMXY2 101.324 PERMZ2 10.1324 PORO2 0.20
    PERMXY3 202.650 PERMZ3 20.2650 PORO3 0.20
    PERMXY4 506.625 PERMZ4 50.6625 PORO4 0.20
    PERMXY5 1013.25 PERMZ5 101.325 PORO5 0.25
    PERMXYP 2013.25 PERMZP 201.325 POROP 0.45

As seen from the previous values, the finnest sand corresponds to No. 2 and it gets coarser
towards sand No. 5.

.. note::
    The names for the saturation functions and rock properties are not used in the framework (they are used to
    ease the visualization of the parameter values in the configuration file, i.e., writing SWIX in line 22 has 
    no impact, so far the name has at least one character since this is used in the reading of the values). 

***********************
Well-related parameters
***********************

Now we proceed to define the schedule for the injection well. Here the injection well is located from the
top to the bottom on the left side of the domain and the injection is given as kg/day:  

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 41

    """Define the injection values""" 
    """injection time [d], time step size to write results [d], maximum time step [d], injected phase (0 wetting, 1 non-wetting), injection rate [kg/day]"""
    7 1e-1 5e-2 1 34566.912
    7 1e-1 5e-2 0 34566.912
    7 1e-1 5e-2 1 34566.912

Here CO2 (non-wetting phase) is injected for seven days printing the results 70 times and limmiting the time step
to 5e-2 days, after water (wetting phase) is injected for the same period at the same mass rate, and finally CO2 is 
reinjected for the same period. 

.. warning::
    Keep the linebreak between the sections in the whole configuration file (in the current implementation this is used for the reading of the parameters).
